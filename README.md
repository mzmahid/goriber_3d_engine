## Usage

Just open `index.html` in a browser. The cube will automatically start rotating.

## Configuration

- `FPS` – Animation frame rate (default: 60)
- `angle` – Rotation speed
- `vertices` – 8 corner points of the cube
- `edges` – Connections between vertices

## Lessons Learned

- Canvas API
- Weak perspective projection
- Rotation matrices
- World space and screen space
- Usage of objects in JavaScript

Worth it. 🔥
